**Chronos** is a "Time-Travel" audit trail system designed exclusively for the **Filament** ecosystem.

Unlike standard logging tools, Chronos provides a beautiful, visual timeline of your data. It enables administrators to view exactly **who** changed **what** and **when**, with a stunning timeline and side-by-side diff view (Before vs. After) directly within your resource dashboard.

## ✨ Features

* **Visual Diffing:** See exactly what changed with color-coded highlights (Red for deletions, Green for additions).
* **Zero-Config Setup:** Simply add a Trait to your model and an Action to your resource.
* **Time-Travel UI:** A sleek slide-over modal to browse history without leaving the edit page.
* **Secure by Default:** Automatically excludes sensitive fields like passwords and API tokens.
* **User Attribution:** Tracks which user (and IP address) performed the action.
* **Dark Mode Support:** Fully integrated with Filament's native theme.
